* The previous commit included the minc.h header to define NC_UNSPECIFIED. However,
the minc.h header specifies that NC_UNSPECIFIED -> NC_NAT -> MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE

 * Revision 6.4  2001/04/24 13:38:40  neelin
 * Replaced NC_NAT with MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE.
 *
 * Revision 6.3  2001/04/17 18:40:13  neelin
 * Modifications to work with NetCDF 3.x
 * In particular, changed NC_LONG to NC_INT (and corresponding longs to ints).
 * Changed NC_UNSPECIFIED to NC_NAT.
 * A few fixes to the configure script.

And so we only need to define NC_UNSPECIFIED locally in case it is not defined yet:

#ifndef NC_UNSPECIFIED
#  define NC_UNSPECIFIED MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE
#endif

Also minc2 definitions are defined in minc2_defs.h in the BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit. So this is
now included in VolumeIO_constants.c for all the definitions used there.

* After trying to install py_minc on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise against commit f1077df034 
from the BIC-MNI/minc-toolkit repostiry on GitHub, I ran into some compile errors. The
first were warnings of the form:

src/volume_io_wrapper.c:129:25: error 'NC_UNSPECIFIED' undeclared ...

This is defined in minc.h, and so I included this header in volume_io_wrapper.c This had
to be done similarly in VolumeIO_constants.c


* Secondly, the function declaration for create_grid_transform and create_grid_transform_no_copy
from volume_io/vol_io_prototypes.h (part of the MINC libraries) is different compared to 
the regural libminc, and has an additional argument:

VIOAPI void create_grid_transform(
  VIO_General_transform *transform,
  VIO_Volume displacement_volume,
  VIO_STR displacement_volume_file );

This has to be included in the src/VolumeIO_a.i file which swig uses to access the functions
in the minc library.
