Installation notes for py_minc library


py_minc is python module for working with the MINC data format.

Installation in a local account on a typical system is as follows

python setup.py install --home /home/jgsled

The py_minc module includes an extension written in C that depends on the 
libraries volume_io2, minc2, netcdf, and hdf5.  If these libraries are
not installed in the default system locations then additional options
are required to build the library.  For example,

# build
python setup.py build_ext -I /projects/mice/share/arch/linux-x86_64-eglibc2_11_1/include -L /projects/mice/share/arch/linux-x86_64-eglibc2_11_1/lib
python setup.py build

# install
python setup.py install --home /home/jgsled


Additional options allow greater control of the installation directory
names.  For example

python setup.py install --install-lib /home/jgsled/lib64_ubuntu_hardy/python
python setup.py install --prefix /home/jgsled --install-lib /home/jgsled/lib64_ubuntu_lucid/python


See python setup.py --help for details.
